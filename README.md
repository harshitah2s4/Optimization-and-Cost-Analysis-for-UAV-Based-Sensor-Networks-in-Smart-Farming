This project aims to analyze and optimize the operational costs and efficiency of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with sensors for smart farming applications. The study involves evaluating various cost components associated with UAV operations.Finally our approach is compared with two other approaches, hence proving our model is the most optimal one.
